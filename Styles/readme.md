## Final Styles

Each card template has its own unique styles, which are defined individually and then combined into a unified stylesheet. These styles can certainly be refined further with additional tweaks.

### Where to Add `all.css`

#### On Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)
1. Open Anki and go to **Tools** → **Manage Note Types**.
2. Select your desired note type (or create a new one).
3. Click **Cards...**.
4. Switch to the **Styling** tab.
5. Paste the entire contents of the `all.css` file into the styling section.

#### On Android (AnkiDroid)
1. Open the deck overview screen.
2. Tap the three dots (overflow menu) in the top right.
3. Select **Manage note types**.
4. Choose your desired note type (or add a new one).
5. Tap **Cards** (or the styling option, depending on the version).
6. Paste the entire contents of the `all.css` file into the styling section.

**Note:** Changes made on one platform will sync to others via AnkiWeb synchronization. For the best experience, test your styles on both desktop and mobile after applying them.
