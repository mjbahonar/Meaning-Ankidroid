Anki Word-Wizard is a powerful Python-based tool designed to supercharge the flashcard creation process for language learners and dedicated **Anki** users. It takes a simple list of words and automatically enriches it with high-quality data scraped from multiple online sources, saving you countless hours of manual work.

The script generates detailed definitions, translations, usage examples, and relevant images, then compiles everything into clean, Anki-ready `.csv` and `.xlsx` files.

### ü§î What is Anki/AnkiDroid?

For those new to it, [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) (and its Android version, [AnkiDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&hl=en&gl=US)) is a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that uses a **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)**. This learning technique schedules card reviews at increasingly long intervals, making it incredibly efficient for long-term memorization of vocabulary, concepts, and more. This script helps you create the rich, detailed cards needed for effective learning.

### Code Structure

The project is organized into two main files:

*   üìú `main_script.py`: This is the master script and your main point of interaction. It reads your word list from an Excel file, calls the various scraper functions for each word, and saves the final compiled data into output files.
*   ü¶æ `scraper_functions.py`: This file is a library of specialized "worker" functions. Each function is designed to perform a specific task, such as scraping a particular website (like Fastdic or Cambridge) or downloading images from Google. This modular design makes it easy to maintain and customize.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **üìö Multi-Source Scraping**: Gathers data from a variety of reliable sources:
    *   **Fastdic** (English-Persian Dictionary)
    *   **Faraazin** (English-Persian Dictionary)
    *   **Google Translate** (For quick translations into any language)
    *   **Google Dictionary** (For in-depth English definitions, synonyms, and antonyms)
    *   **Cambridge Dictionary** (For detailed definitions and example sentences)
*   **üñºÔ∏è Automatic Image Downloader**: Fetches and downloads relevant clipart images for each word to create visually engaging flashcards.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Powerful Batch Processing**: Processes an entire vocabulary list from an Excel file in one go.
*   **‚úîÔ∏è Anki-Ready Output**: Generates clean, styled HTML content in the output files, perfect for direct import and mapping to your Anki card fields.
*   **üîß Highly Customizable**: Easily choose which scrapers to run, change the translation language, or adjust the number of images to download.
*   **ü§ñ Robust and Automated**: Uses Selenium to interact with modern, JavaScript-heavy websites, ensuring reliable data extraction where simpler methods fail.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following set up:

1.  **üêç Python 3.x**: Download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **üåê Google Chrome**: This script uses Selenium to control Chrome, so you must have the browser installed.
3.  **üîë ChromeDriver**: You need the specific driver that **matches your Google Chrome version**.
    *   **Find Your Chrome Version**: In Chrome, go to `Settings` > `About Chrome` to see your version (e.g., `126.0.6478.127`).
    *   **Download ChromeDriver**: Go to the [Chrome for Testing availability dashboard](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) and download the `chromedriver` zip file for your version.
    *   **Place the Driver**: Unzip the file and place the `chromedriver.exe` executable inside the `chromedriver-win64` folder included in this project.

## üíª Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mjbahonar/Meaning-Ankidroid.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install Required Libraries**
    Using a virtual environment is highly recommended.
    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install all project dependencies
    pip install pandas openpyxl selenium beautifulsoup4 requests googletrans Pillow python-dotenv pyperclip
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)**
    This step allows the script to save a copy of all downloaded images directly into your Anki media folder, making them instantly available in your collection.
    *   **Important Note:** To use this feature, you must have the [Anki desktop application for Windows](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) installed and have logged into your profile at least once. This is necessary because the script needs to save images to the `collection.media` folder, which is only created after you set up a profile in the Anki app.
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory.
    *   Add the following line, replacing the path with the correct path for your system:
        ```
        # Example for Windows. "YourProfile" is the name of your Anki profile.
        ADDRESS="C:/Users/YourUser/AppData/Roaming/Anki2/YourProfile/collection.media"
        ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  **‚úçÔ∏è Prepare Your Word List**
    *   Create an Excel file (e.g., `3A-part3.xlsx`) in the root project directory.
    *   Put your vocabulary words in the first column (`A`). **Do not use a header row**.

2.  **‚öôÔ∏è Configure the Main Script**
    *   Open `main_script.py`.
    *   Update the `baseName` variable to match your Excel file's name (without the `.xlsx` extension).
        ```python
        # If your file is named "My-Vocab-List.xlsx"
        baseName = 'My-Vocab-List'
        ```

3.  **üöÄ Run the Script**
    Open your terminal in the project directory and execute:
    ```bash
    python main_script.py
    ```    The script will begin processing, and you'll see progress updates printed in your terminal.

4.  **üéâ Get Your Output**
    *   When the script is done, you will find two new timestamped files:
        *   `output_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_baseName.xlsx`
        *   `output_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_baseName.csv`
    *   These files contain your original words plus all the rich content scraped from the web.

## üé® Customization

You can easily tweak the script to fit your exact needs.

### How to Change the Google Translate Language

By default, words are translated to Persian (`fa`). You can change this to any other language.

1.  Open the `scraper_functions.py` file.
2.  Find the `scrape_and_process_google_translate` function.
3.  Change the `dest='fa'` parameter to your desired language code.
    ```python
    # Find this line:
    translation = translator.translate(word, src='en', dest='fa')

    # Change it for Spanish:
    translation = translator.translate(word, src='en', dest='es')

    # Or for French:
    translation = translator.translate(word, src='en', dest='fr')
    ```
    You can find a list of language codes [here](https://py-googletrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#googletrans-languages).

### How to Change the Number of Downloaded Images

By default, the script downloads **4** images per word.

1.  Open the `main_script.py` file.
2.  Find the line where `download_images` is called.
3.  Change the value of the `n` parameter.
    ```python
    # To download 6 images instead of 4:
    df['Downloaded_Images_HTML'] = df.apply(lambda row: download_images(row['Words'], row.name + 1, n=6), axis=1)
    ```

## üì≤ Importing to Anki & What Your Card Will Look Like

The generated `.csv` file is formatted for easy import into Anki.

1.  **In Anki**, go to `File` > `Import...` and select your `output_... .csv` file.
2.  The import dialog will appear. Make sure you:
    *   Select the correct **Note Type** (e.g., "Basic").
    *   Select the correct **Deck**.
    *   **Map the fields**: Map each column from the CSV to the corresponding field in your Anki note type. For example:
        *   Column 1 (`Words`) -> `Front` field
        *   Column 2 (`Processed_Content_Faraazin...`) -> `Faraazin Definition` field
        *   Column 5 (`Downloaded_Images_HTML`) -> `Images` field
    *   Ensure the "Allow HTML in fields" option is **checked**.
